ImCat is a fast and simple way to add keywords to all the images in your gallery. It uses an embedded database to track and save the categories of different images.

Upon starting the app, you have the options to either load an entire folder at once or load individual images. You will then be able to assign different labels to the images by clicking on the "Assign" button. Enter all the labels you want, separated by commas. Be aware that spelling is important! Two differently spelled words will result in two different categories.

After you have classified the images, you will be able to see albums for all the different categories appearing on the app's homepage, allowing you to access and view them. The albums are sorted alphabetically.
